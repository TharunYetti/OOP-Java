# Object-Oriented Programming with Java

This repository contains all the Java programs I have written and practiced as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java course. The programs focus on key OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, and other advanced Java topics.

## Repository Structure

- **Basics**: Simple Java programs covering basic syntax, data types, and control structures.
- **OOP Concepts**: Programs demonstrating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
- **Advanced Topics**: Examples of exception handling, file I/O, multithreading, collections, etc.
