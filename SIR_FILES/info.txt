Different modules specified in the design document are coded in the 
coding phase according to the module specification
The main goal of the coding phase is to code from the design documents 
prepared after the design phase through a high-level language and 
then to unit test this code.
Good software development organizations want their programmers 
to maintain to some well-defined and standard style of coding 
called coding standards.
They usually make their own coding standards and 
guidelines depending on what suits for their organization 
best and based on the types of software they are going to develop
It is very important for the programmers to maintain 
the coding standards otherwise the code will be rejected during code review.
